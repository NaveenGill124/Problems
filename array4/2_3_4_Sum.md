### What I learned with two Sum problem
- Started with a brute-force O(n²) approach, then refactored to an O(n) solution using a hash map to track seen numbers and their indices.  
- For each `num`, compute `comp = target - num`, check the map in O(1), and store `num` if not found.

### What I learned with Three Sum problem
- Used sorting and the two-pointer approach inside a loop to reduce time complexity to `O(n²)`.
- Learned how to skip duplicates effectively and manage triplet combinations without repeating results.

### What I learned with Four Sum problem
- Initially struggled with missing valid combinations due to pointer misplacement.
- Refined the solution using two nested loops and a two-pointer strategy `(O(n³))`, with proper duplicate handling.
- Understood how to generalize the pattern from 2-sum and 3-sum into 4-sum with correct iteration and pruning.
