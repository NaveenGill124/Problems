#### Two Sum

- Solved using a hashmap in O(n) time.
- Learned to check for the complement (target - num) while iterating.

#### Three Sum

- Requires sorting and careful handling of duplicates.
- Learned two-pointer technique inside a loop to find triplets in O(n²) time.

#### Four Sum

- Initially missed combinations due to improper pointer logic.
- Refined the approach with two nested loops + two-pointer, handled duplicates properly.
- Achieved an optimized solution with O(n³) time.
