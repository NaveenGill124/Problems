## What I learned

### Sort Colors Problem
- While the built-in `nums.sort()` one-liner is concise, it runs in O(n log n) time; the Dutch National Flag algorithm partitions the three colors in a single pass (O(n) time, O(1) space), making it far more efficient for this problem.  
- This shows that brevity in code doesn’t always equate to optimal performance—sometimes a few extra lines unlock significant time savings.
