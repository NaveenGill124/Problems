## What I Learned

I learned about **Kadane's Algorithm** and how it efficiently solves the Maximum Subarray problem in **O(n)** time complexity. 

Before discovering Kadane’s approach, I attempted solutions using brute force and nested loops, which resulted in **O(n²)** or even **O(n³)** time complexity. These approaches were not optimal for large inputs and led to performance issues.

Kadane's Algorithm offers a much better and elegant solution by iterating through the array once and dynamically tracking the maximum subarray sum. It's a great example of how a greedy approach can drastically improve efficiency in certain problems.

This was a valuable learning experience in understanding both **algorithm optimization** and **time complexity analysis**.
