## What I Learned
### Next Permutation
- In solving “Next Permutation,” I learned to break the problem into clear steps—identifying the pivot, swapping with the next larger element, and reversing the suffix—to systematically generate the next lexicographical order.  
- Along the way, I refreshed key Python techniques like reverse loops, in-place swaps, and efficient slice operations.
