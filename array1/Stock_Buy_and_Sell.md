## What I Learned
### Stock Buy and Sell

I learned that to solve the stock profit problem, we only need to keep track of the minimum stock price so far and calculate the maximum profit by comparing the current day's price with that minimum. This allows us to find the best time to buy and sell in a single pass through the list.
