# 📘 LeetCode Problems & Learnings

Welcome to my curated collection of important **LeetCode problems**, where I've organized and solved challenges with a focus on learning, consistency, and self-improvement.

## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is designed to document my problem-solving journey on LeetCode. Each problem is stored in its own folder and includes:

- ✅ The **problem solution** (in code).
- 📝 A **README.md** explaining:
  - What the problem is about.
  - My **approach** to solving it.
  - **Where I got stuck** (if applicable).
  - **What I learned** from solving it.

## 📂 Structure

📁 Problem-Name/
├── solution.py (or .cpp/.js, etc.)

Each folder is named after the corresponding problem to maintain clarity and organization.

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve my **DSA** (Data Structures & Algorithms) skills.
