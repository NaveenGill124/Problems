## What I Learned
- Learned how to detect cycles in a linked list using different approaches.

- Understood that checking if node in visited compares node references, not values.

- Improved brute-force with set for faster 'O(1)' lookup.

- I implemented Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare), which uses two pointers moving at different speeds. This approach efficiently detects cycles using only constant space (O(1)) and linear time (O(n)).

- Gained a better grasp of pointers, object identity, and space-time optimization.
