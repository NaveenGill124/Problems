## What I Learned

### Add Two Numbers
- Learned how to traverse two linked lists simultaneously and add corresponding digits while managing different lengths.
- Understood how to handle carry-over during digit-wise addition, similar to elementary school arithmetic.
- Used a dummy node to simplify the construction of the result linked list without special cases for the head node.
- Handled edge cases such as unequal list lengths and a remaining carry after processing both lists.
- Practiced Pythonic conditional checks (e.g., `while l1 or l2:` instead of `while l1 != None or l2 != None:`).
