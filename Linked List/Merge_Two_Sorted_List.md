## What I Learned

### Merge Two Sorted Lists
- This problem helped me understand how recursion can simplify operations on linked lists.
- I learned the importance of defining clear base cases to ensure correct termination.
- It showed me how to recursively merge sorted nodes by comparing values and linking accordingly.
- I realized how recursion can be used to build a solution step-by-step by solving smaller subproblems first.
- Overall, a great problem to strengthen my grasp on both recursion and linked list manipulation.
