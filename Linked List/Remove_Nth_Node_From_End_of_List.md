## What I Learned

### Remove Nth Node From End of List

- Understood how to remove the N-th node from the end by finding its position from the start (`length - n`).
- Learned to handle edge cases like removing the head node or when the list has only one node.
- Reinforced safe pointer updates by checking if `curr.next` is not `None` before modifying links.
- Improved confidence in solving linked list problems with indexing and boundary checks.
